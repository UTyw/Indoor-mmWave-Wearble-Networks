%Millimeter wave serves as an ideal solution for short range high bandwidth applications in wearable networks.
%The dense indoor wearable network poses challenges to the design of MAC protocols: different propagation of mmWave; large density of devices and user dynamics; heterogeneity in transmission capabilities and QoS requirements of devices.
In this paper, we explore the salient characteristics of interference amongst users in dense indoor mmWave wearable networks and study their impact on MAC scheduling.
We first examine the characteristics (number, location and sensitivity to motion) of ``strong interferers'', i.e., interferers a MAC scheduler would need to be cognizant of in a dense environment.
We show the number of strong interferers remains roughly constant for highly dense scenarios, and the ``worst case'', i.e., highest number of interferers and most sensitivity to motion, occurs at intermediate densities.
We then consider current MAC design leveraging clustering and hierarchy, and propose a model to study the relationship between cluster size and network performance.
Analysis shows that clustering mitigates interference but may provide less resource ruse.
More importantly, the resource allocated to each user stays roughly constant, indicating that scheduling in dense wearable networks can be scalable with user density.
%Optimal cluster size and resources allocated to each user remain roughly the same for high user densities.

\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}
% 1. Motivation
The market for wearable devices has been growing quickly \cite{wearable} and research on wearable networks is now actively being pursued. 
In the future, users may be equipped with multiple on body interconnected devices, some of which may require high bandwidth, e.g., devices supporting high quality audio/video and augmented reality. 
To support such high data rates and high user densities, millimeter wave communication has been proposed as a possible solution and standards have been developed for short-range wireless personal area network (WPAN) in the mmWave band, e.g., 802.11ad \cite{80211ad}, 802.15.3c \cite{802153c} and ECMA387 \cite{ECMA387}.


% 2. Challenges
Dense wearable networks on the mmWave band present a somewhat different operational setting for MAC schedulers, which is worth reexamining.


Signal propagation in the mmWave band is different from bands traditionally used for mobile wireless devices. 
Path loss (PL) in the mmWave band is higher, thus the transmission range is short, and mmWave transmissions experience higher loss due to blockage. 
This makes the channel depends mostly on the availability of line-of-sight (LOS) channels or major reflected non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.
Futher, the human body introduces a path loss of over 20dB \cite{humanshadowing} thus movements of a user and its neighbors may greatly change the environment.
Devices on the mmWave band usually use directional transmissions and reception, thus the antenna gain is non-uniform. 
As a result, the channels in mmWave band are highly sensitive to the environment and user motions. 
However, these characteristics are not necessarily shortcomings, e.g., short range, directionality and blockage can reduce the interference seen by receivers, naturally simplifying the interference management. 


In this paper we focus on dense indoor environments with possibly very high user densities and dynamics, e.g., a crowded train cart.
Such setting correspond to one of the extreme environments where the technology should be seamlessly operational. 
It is an open question how the MAC protocol should adapt to work in such environments, e.g., how much overheads are required to coordinate potential many interferers and handle user dynamics.


Another key characteristic of mmWave wearable network is the possible heterogeneity of devices. 
Wearable devices may have different transmission capabilities in terms of beamforming/directionality, computation associated with transmissions, transmit power and energy, etc. 
Moreover, the traffic patterns of users are different, some users may have highly directional link between smart phone and augmented reality device while other users have multiple low-directional devices.
% use different directionality for different environments. 
Such heterogeneity makes it challenging to optimize MAC protocols to guarantee desired Quality-of-Service (QoS).


The above characteristics affect MAC design in different ways. 
The nature of mmWave propagation makes it possible to achieve higher spatial reuse, but scheduling users is challenging as the signaling can be unreliable and the interference \underline{chartuislus} may change frequently.
The high density of users and user dynamics in indoor environments suggests that the MAC protocols should coordinate among users using limited signaling to reduce overhead. 
Heterogeneity of devices may require transmissions be treated differently and the MAC should adapt to different devices and QoS requirements.

\emph{Contributions}
We rev-evaluate the nature of mmWave propagation for dense wearable networks to better understand the role of interference and the need for coordination and MAC scheduling in such environments. 
Our primary goal is to study the characteristics, i.e., number, location and sensitivity to motion, of ``strong interferers'' as seen by a typical receiver in a dense wearable environment. 
The strong interferers are those that in principle a MAC protocol would aim to address through scheduling. 
We note that some work has been done on analyzing the signal-to-interference-ratio (SINR) distribution in dense wearable networks but they mostly assume there is no scheduling or simple protocols like Aloha \cite{interferencefinitesized}\cite{enclosedmmwave}.

Our main findings regarding the interference environment include: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The number of strong interferers does keep increasing with user density. 
	The average number reaches a peak then starts decreasing due to human body blockage. 
	\item In highly dense environments, most strong interferers are actually close by as the close neighbors around the user form a ``ring'' round the user blocking more distant interferers. 
	\item Strong interferers that are close by are less sensitive to users' local motions than those that are further away. 
\end{itemize}

These results suggest in dense wearable networks, the transmissions of nearby neighbors are those that one should coordinate to mitigate interference.  
The number of nearby neighbors is limited, thus the coordination overheads can be scalable, i.e., different user densities may require roughly the same amount of signaling overhead. 
The ``worst case'', e.g., where users see highest number of interferers and most sensitivity to motion, does not necessarily correspond to scenarios with the highest user density due to blockage.

We then revisit current approaches to MAC design for wearable networks which leverage clustering and hierarchical scheduling. 
Our goal here is to study the relationship between cluster size and network performance in high density scenarios given the particular characteristics of mmWave propagation discussed above. 

Our main findings regarding MAC and scheduling with clustering include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The trade-offs associated with cluster size: large clusters reduce inter-cluster interference but require more overheads and result in reduced reuse versus small clusters.
	\item Heterogeneity of device transmission capabilities impacts the best cluster size: highly directional transmissions requires smaller cluster size while low directional transmissions require larger clusters to mitigate interference. 
	\item The best cluster size is fairly insensitive to user density when it is high. 
	\item The resources allocated to each user may not decrease with density, thus the total reuse of the network may scale with user density.
\end{itemize}

These results suggest that the cluster size is not sensitive to user densities, but may need to adapt to changes in device transmission capabilities and traffic patterns. 
Further, optimization of clustering might be most challenging in scenarios with intermediate density.

Subsequently the authors in \cite{enclosedmmwave} modeled the SINR in random networks in an enclosed environment and incorporate the first order reflections off the walls, the ceiling and the floor. 
The analysis of the interference in the mmWave band has mainly focused on the distribution of the SINR where users are uncoordinated, i.e., users either all transmit or use simple MAC protocols like Aloha, where users transmit with a given probability.
\cite{humanactivity}\cite{timevaryingpathshadowing}\cite{blockagein60ghz}study the impact of human mobility on fixed channels through measurements and simulation, but how the set of interferers is influenced is still unknown.

In dense wearable networks, the MAC protocol needs to coordinate the devices in different users body networks to improve reuse and ensure application QoS.

In dense wearable networks, the above MAC protocols may fail to coordinate amongst the users due to the large number of users or dynamic channels.

\section{Interference in Dense mmWave Wearable Networks}\label{section:interference}
In this section we try to characterize the interference environment a user would experience, i.e., the set of strong interferers.

\subsection{System Model for Wearable Network}\label{section:channel:model}
We consider the channel between two users from a MAC design perspective, i.e., whether the channel is strong enough that the two users can interfere with each other. 
We define two users are strong interferers to each other if the PL of the channel between them is above a threshold.

Consider a wearable network consisting of users standing on a 2-D plane.
Let $x_i$ denote the location of the center of user $i$, $u_i$. 
The devices on each user form a personal basic service set (PBSS), coordinated by the PBSS Control Point (PCP), e.g., the user's smart phone.
There is no access point (AP) or central controller coordinating or synchronizing users.
Walls and obstructions other than human bodies are not considered (although could easily be incorporated), and there is a ceiling at a height of $h_{\mathrm{ceiling}}$ meters. 


For simplicity, we assume the locations of PCPs on the human body are the same and the users' bodies are of the same dimension. 
The height of users is $h_{\mathrm{body}}$ and the PCPs are located in front of user's bodies at a height of $h_{\mathrm{device}}$.
A typical user, $u_0$, is placed at $0$ with an orientation $\theta_0$. 
The locations of the other users $\Phi=\{x_i\}_i$ follows a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (HPPP) with density $\lambda$.
The orientation of user $i$, $\theta_i$, are independently uniformly distributed in $[0, 2\pi]$, $\theta_i\sim \mathrm{uniform}(0,2\pi)$.
The network is then modeled as an independent marked point process (i.m.p.p.) $\tilde{\Phi}=\{(x_i, \theta_i)\}_i$.


We use the link between the centers of two users to approximate the actual channel between their PCPs. 
Only two channels are considered, the LOS channel and the reflected channel over the ceiling, which we refer to as the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel.
The LOS channel follows free space propagation while the PL of the reflected channel is determined by the free space path loss and reflection coefficient, $\Gamma$, which is a function of incident angel and reflection material \cite{reflection}.


If a channel is blocked by human body, the PL is 0.
The PL between two users is approximated by the PL of the LOS channel if the LOS channel presents, or the PL of the NLOS channel if the LOS channel is blocked.
For self blockage, we assume user body would block both LOS and NLOS channels from devices behind the user as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:channel:self-blockage}. 
We say that two users are ``facing'' each other if they are in the not self-blocked region of each other.


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.3\textwidth]{Channel_selfblockage.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of model for self-blockage. The arrow indicates the orientation of the user.}
	\label{fig:channel:self-blockage}
\end{figure}

Given $h_{\mathrm{ceiling}}$, $h_{\mathrm{device}}$ and reflection model, the PL of channels (not including blockage) is a function of the distance between them.
Subsequently, a user located at $x$, $u_x$, is a strong interferer of $u_0$ if  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PL_LOS}
|x| < r_{\max}
\end{equation}
if the LOS channel is available, and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PL_NLOS}
|x| < r_{\max}^{\mathrm{reflection}}
\end{equation}
if only the NLOS channel is not blocked.
$|x|$ is the distance between $u_x$ and $u_0$, $r_{\max}$ is the max distance of a LOS strong interferer and $r_{\max}^{\mathrm{reflection}}$ is the maximum distance of a reflected strong interferer. Notice that the PL of the NLOS channel may not be a monotonic decreasing function of $|x|$ due to the reflection coefficient thus (\ref{eq:PL_NLOS}) is only an necessary condition in some scenarios but it can be easily extended to account for the actual PL.

There are many complex factors involved in mmWave propagation and we use simple model to capture the salient features.

\subsection{Number of Strong Interferers}\label{section:channel:number}
In this section we analyze the number of strong interferers seen by a typical user, $N_{\mathrm{SI}}$. 
$N_{\mathrm{SI}}$ can be written as follows, 
\begin{equation}
N_{\mathrm{SI}}(\tilde{\Phi}, \theta_0) = \sum_{(x_i, \theta_i)\in \tilde{\Phi}}f_0(x_i, \theta_i, \tilde{\Phi}\backslash\{(x_i,\theta_i)\}, \theta_0)
\end{equation}
where $f_0(x_i, \theta_i, \tilde{\Phi}\backslash\{(x_i,\theta_i)\}, \theta_0)$ is the indicator function that $(x_i, \theta_i)$ is a strong interferer of the typical user $(0,\theta_0)$.

$N_{\mathrm{SI}}$ depends on the realization of $\tilde{\Phi}$, making the distribution of $N_{\mathrm{SI}}$ hard to compute. 
Still the average number of strong interferers is a good metric to capture the MAC coordination requirements/overhead.


To compute $\E[N_{\mathrm{SI}}]$ we first compute the probability that the channel between $u_0$ and $u_x$ is blocked by other users. 
A user $(x', \theta')$ blocks the LOS channel between $u_0$ and $u_x$ if it meets the following conditions, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{subfig:channel:blockage:LOS}: 
1) the center of $x'$ on the line from $0$ to $x$, $s_x(x')$ lies on the channel, $s_x(x')\in [0,|x|]$; 
2) the cross section of user body projection on $n_x$,  $D_x(x, \theta')$, covers the origin $0$, $0 \in D_x(x, \theta')$. 
For the NLOS channel, a third condition need to added: the height of user where user intersect with $0$ and $x$, $h_x(x',\theta')$, is larger than the height of the reflected channel at that point, see Fig.~\ref{subfig:channel:blockage:NLOS}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

	\caption[]{\subref{subfig:channel:blockage:LOS} shows the condition that user $(x', \theta')$ blocks the LOS channel between $0$ and $x$. \subref{subfig:channel:blockage:NLOS} illustrate the additional condition required for NLOS channel.}
	\label{fig:channel:blockage}
\end{figure}

The probability that a user located at $x$ is a LOS strong interferer of the typical user can then be computed in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:E_N_B_LOS}
	If user locations follow HPPP with density $\lambda$, the number of users blocking the LOS channel between $0$ and $x$, $N_\mathrm{B}^\mathrm{LOS}(x)$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\mathrm{E}[N_{\mathrm{B}}^\mathrm{LOS}(x)] \approx \lambda |x| \mathrm{E}[D]$, where $\mathrm{E}[D]$ is the expected width of a user's cross section at $h_{\mathrm{device}}$.
	
	The probability that the LOS channel is not blocked is $e^{-\E[N_\mathrm{B}^\mathrm{LOS}(x)]}$.
\end{theorem}

The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:E_N_B_LOS} includes proving that $N_B^{\LOS}$ is a thinned Poisson \cite{poisson} and Campbell's formula \cite{stochasticgeometry}.
For NLOS channel, $N_{\mathrm{B}}^\mathrm{NLOS}(x)$ also follows Poisson distribution and its mean is related to the environment and shape of users. 


We make an assumption regarding the blockage of LOS and NLOS channel: if the NLOS channel is blocked, then the LOS channel is also blocked. 
In this case, the probability that $u_x$ is a strong interferer is equal to the probability that $u_x$ is an NLOS strong interferer if $|x|<r_{\text{max}}^{\mathrm{reflection}}$.


Based on the above analysis and assumptions, $\E[N_{\mathrm{SI}}]$ can be computed using the Reduced Campbell's formula for i.m.p.p. of Corollary 2.2 in \cite{stochasticgeometry} as follows,
\begin{multline}\label{eq:E_N_SI}
\mathrm{E}[N_{\mathrm{SI}}] =  \mathrm{P}_{\text{facing}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2} 
 \big[\text{1}(|x|\in[r_{\min},r_{\text{max}}^{\mathrm{reflection}}])
\cdot e^{-\mathrm{E}[N_{\mathrm{B}}^\mathrm{NLOS}(x)]} \\
+ \text{1}(|x|\in[r_{\text{max}}^{\mathrm{reflection}},r_{\text{max}}])
\cdot e^{-\mathrm{E}[N_{\mathrm{B}}^\mathrm{LOS}(x)]} \big]\lambda(\mathrm{d}x),
\end{multline}
where $r_{\min}$ is the minimum distance between users, $P_{\text{facing}}$ is the probability that $u_x$ and $u_0$ faces each other.


In dense scenario, HPPP may not be a good approximation of the locations of the users as users can not overlap with each other and this may affect the accuracy of our result for $\E[N_{\mathrm{SI}}]$.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:channel:en_si} we compare the analysis with simulation.
Users are modeled as cylinders with a diameter of 0.6m, and we use Mat\'ern \Rom{3} process \cite{matern} to model user locations in simulations.
Our analytical results are in line with the simulations, validating the accuracy of the approximation. 
$\mathrm{E}[N_{\mathrm{SI}}]$ first grows with the user density, but as user density further increases, it stops increasing.
Users see the largest number of strong interferers at moderately high user densities.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:Channel_si_pdf} illustrates the distribution for the distance of strong interferers for varying user densities. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:channel:jamming} shows the locations of strong interferers in one realization of the network.
As user density increases, the strong interferers tend to concentrate close to the receiver. When user density is very high, the network reaches a ``jamming regime'', where strong interferers are mostly close by and block further away interferers as shown in Fig.~\subref{fig:channel:jamming:15}.

%Such results indicate that it might be enough to coordinate close neighboring users.


\subsection{Sensitivity of Strong Interferers}\label{section:channel:sensitivity}
In this section we study the sensitivity of strong interferers to users' small local movements.
The sensitivity of strong interferers, i.e., how the set of strong interferers changes when users move, influences the cost and benefit of tracking and coordinating with such neighbors.
 
Suppose in a time interval $[t, t+ \Delta t]$, users make independent small scale movements, i.e., translation and rotation. 
The changes for the typical user and potential interferers are summarized as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
(0,\theta_0)&\rightarrow(\Delta x_0, \theta_0 + \Delta\theta_0), \\
\tilde{\Phi}^{t}=\{(x_i, \theta_i)\}&\rightarrow\tilde{\Phi}^{t+\Delta t}=\{(x_i+\Delta x_i, \theta_i + \Delta\theta_i)\},
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta x$ is the translation and $\Delta \theta$ is the angle of rotation, both $\Delta x$ and $\Delta\theta$ are identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.).

Let $Y_x^t=f_0(x, \theta, \tilde{\Phi}^t\backslash (x, \theta), \theta_0)$ be the indicator that $u_x$ is a strong interferer at time $t$, and $Y_x^{t+\Delta t}$ be the state of the same user at $t+\Delta t$, which is given by,
\begin{multline*}
Y_{x}^{t+\Delta t} = f_{\Delta x_0}(x+\Delta x, \theta + \Delta\theta, \tilde{\Phi}^{t+\Delta t}\backslash (x+\Delta x, \theta + \Delta\theta), \\
\theta_0 + \Delta\theta_0),
\end{multline*}
$Y_x^t \mathrm{~and~} Y_{x}^{t+\Delta t} \in \{0,1\}$. 
%$Y = 1$ if the user is a strong interferer of the typical user and $Y = 0$ otherwise. 
We define the sensitivity of an interferer originally located at $x$ for an interval of length $\Delta t$, $S(x, \Delta t)$, based on the autocorrelation of the state of the interferer at $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ as follows, 
\begin{equation}
S(x, \Delta t)
=\mathrm{Corr}(Y_x^t, Y_x^{t+\Delta t})
=\frac{\mathrm{E}[Y_x^t\cdot Y_x^{t + \Delta t}]}{\sigma_{Y_x^t}\cdot \sigma_{Y_x^{t+\Delta t}}},
\end{equation}
$S(x, \Delta t)\in [0,1]$. If $S(x, \Delta t)$ is small, the autocorrelation between the states of the channel is small and the channel sensitive to movements; if $S(x, \Delta t)$ is close to $1$, the autocorrelation is high and the interferer is stable.

Based on our assumptions on $\tilde{\Phi}$ and i.i.d. movements, $\tilde{\Phi}^t$ is stationary (using the Displacement Theorem \cite{poisson}).
As a result, 
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{Y_x^t} = \sigma_{Y_x^{t+\Delta t}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{SI}}(x)\cdot (1-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{SI}}(x)),
\end{equation*}
where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{SI}}(x)=\mathrm{Pr}(f_0(x,\theta,\tilde{\Phi}\backslash\{(x_i,\theta_i)\}, \theta_0)=1)$. 
$\mathrm{E}[Y_x^t\cdot Y_x^{t + \Delta t}]$ is the probability that user at $x$ is strong interferer at $t$ and $t + \Delta t$,
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{E}[Y_x^t\cdot Y_x^{t + \Delta t}] = \mathrm{Pr}(\{Y_x^t=1\}\cap \{Y_x^{t+\Delta t}=1\}).
\end{equation*}
The movements of users during $\Delta t$, $(\Delta x, \Delta \theta)$ can be included as the marks of $\Phi$, and we have a new i.m.p.p. $\tilde{\Phi}^{\Delta t} = \{(x_i, m_i)\}_i$, where $m_i = (\theta_i, \Delta x_i, \Delta \theta_i)$.

Denote $f_0^{\Delta  t}(x_i, m_i, \tilde{\Phi}^{\Delta t}\backslash (x_i, m_i), m_0)$ be the indicator function that the user located at $x$ is a strong interferer at $t$ and $t + \Delta t$, then 
\begin{multline*}
f_0^{\Delta  t}(x_i, m_i, \tilde{\Phi}^{\Delta t}\backslash (x_i, m_i), m_0) = \\
f_0(x,\theta, \tilde{\Phi}, \theta_0) 
\cdot f_{\Delta x_0}(x+\Delta x,\theta + \Delta \theta, 
\\ \tilde{\Phi} + \Delta \tilde{\Phi}\backslash (x+\Delta x,\theta + \Delta \theta), \theta_0+\theta_0),
\end{multline*}
where $\Delta \tilde{\Phi} = \{(\Delta x_i, \Delta \theta_i)\}_i$ is the movement of users during $\Delta t$ and we denote $\tilde{\Phi} + \Delta \tilde{\Phi} = \{(x_i+\Delta x_i, \theta_i + \Delta \theta_i)\}_i$ as the network after users move.  
Given the model of movements, i.e., $F_{(\Delta X, \Delta \Theta)}$, we can compute $\mathrm{E}[f_0^{\Delta t}]$ using the same techniques used in Section \ref{section:channel:number}. 

Next we present the numerical results on the sensitivity of LOS strong interferers for $\Delta t= 1$s.
$\Delta X$ is uniformly distributed in a disc centered at the origin with the radius of $r(\lambda, \Delta t)$, $\Delta X \sim \mathrm{unif}(\mathcal{B}(0, r(\lambda, \Delta t)))$. 
In our analysis, $r(\lambda, \Delta t)$ may decrease with user density in dense environment, e.g.
\begin{equation*}
r(\lambda,\Delta t) = \min(0.23, 0.6 \sqrt{1/\lambda\pi}) \mathrm{~m}.
\end{equation*}
We use this model to capture the fact that users' movements become limited as the distance among users becomes smaller. $\Delta \Theta$ is uniformly distributed in $[-24\degree, 24 \degree]$.

%\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:Channel_sensitivity} exhibits the sensitivity of users at different distances. 
As can be seen, distant interferers are more sensitive to perturbations than close by interferers. 
This supports the observation that close by users (interferers) will be robust to perturbations and learning the interference from close by neighbors is more reliable.

Fig.~\ref{fig:Channel_sensitivity_average} exhibits the average sensitivity of strong interferers $\E[S]$,
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{E}[S] = \lambda\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}S(x,\Delta t)\cdot \mathrm{P_{SI}}(x) \mathrm{d}x,
\end{equation*}
for different user densities.
Strong interferers first become more sensitive to movements as $S(x, \Delta t)$ decreases with $\lambda$. 
In highly dense scenarios, strong interferers are closer and the movements become limited, thus the strong interferers become more robust to user local movements.

%Our analysis on the number and sensitivity of strong interferers indicate that in dense wearable networks, blockage will help reduce interference and the number of strong interferers may not scale with user density.
%Furthermore, the strong interferers mainly consist of close neighbors and the close neighbors are robust to user movements. 
%The MAC protocol may only need to keep track of and coordinate limited number of close neighbors. 
%Furthermore, users see most strong interferers and most sensitive channels at intermediate densities, thus the design of MAC might be most challenging at intermediate user densities.

\section{Optimizing Clustering in Hierarchical Wearable MAC protocols}\label{section:clustering}
In this section, we discuss how to optimize clustering for hierarchical wearable MAC protocols based on our analysis of interference.

\subsection{Hierarchical MAC for Wearable Networks}\label{section:clustering:hierarchy}

When centralized control is absent, hierarchical clustering and scheduling work as a viable solution to coordinating the multiple PBSSs. 


The hierarchical MAC consists of three parts, clustering, channel selection and scheduling at each PBSS, as the distributed clustering in 802.11ad. 
The cluster head synchronizes PBSSs in the cluster and schedules Beacon Transmission Intervals (BTIs) for each cluster member. 
Due to high user density and unstable channels, cluster head may not schedule the data transmissions of other PBSSs.
Channel selection is mainly used to mitigate interference, either performed by the cluster head, or performed by each PBSS. 
Clustering and channel selection help coordinate the PBSSs and are usually performed at a slower time scale. 
In each PBSS, the PCP schedules the data transmissions within the PBSS for each frame while trying to reuse the resource in dense scenarios. 


Current standards leave open the question of how to form cluster and select channels in dense scenarios. 
Another major problem is that the reuse might be limited, e.g., PBSSs may not use the same slots and work in a time devision multiple access (TDMA) like manner if they can hear other's beacon in 802.11ad.


For dense wearable networks, the basic principles underlying clustering is that the channel between cluster head and cluster members be strong and stable. 
To better mitigate inter-cluster interference through channel selection, the cluster members should share a similar set of strong interferers. 

Based on our analysis of channels, a cluster shall consist of users in close proximity and select a different channel from nearby clusters. 
Apart from applying the above basic principles, one must also choose the proper size for clusters. 
Many factors influence the best cluster size, e.g., channel quality to cluster head, signaling cost, inter-cluster interference, etc. 
We try to answer the question by analyzing the network reuse. 


\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width = 0.4\textwidth]{Clustering_reuse.pdf}
	\caption{Distributed clustering  with hierarchical scheduling can achieve higher resource reuse and guarantee basic access to channel.}
	\label{fig:clustering:reuse}
\end{figure}


To achieve better resource reuse within the cluster and meet the basic QoS requirements of each PBSS, a hierarchical scheduling method is proposed and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clustering:reuse}. 
Each PBSS is allocated a reserved slot where it has higher priority than other PBSSs. Other PBSSs may however try to contend with other non-primary PBSSs to reuse the slots if the their transmissions do not interfere with the transmissions of primary PBSS.

\subsection{Modeling Impact of Clustering Size on Achievable Reuse}
In this section we study how cluster size influences the resources made available to each PBSS in a dense wearable networks where clustering and hierarchical scheduling are used. 

We use the same system model as Section \ref{section:interference} and consider the average time that a typical PBSS can perform a successful data transmission, denoted by Successful Transmission Time (STT).
STT is defined as follows, 
\begin{equation*}
STT = f_{\mathrm{data}}\times p_{\mathrm{access}} \times p_{\mathrm{success}},
\end{equation*}
where $f_{\mathrm{data}}$ is the fraction of time reserved for data transmission, $p_{\mathrm{access}}$ is the probability that the PBSS may access the channel and does not interfere with other PBSSs within the same cluster,
$p_{\mathrm{success}}$ is the probability that the transmission is free from inter-cluster interference.

The power received at a receiver is modeled as follows,
\begin{equation*}
P_r = P_t\cdot G_t\cdot G_r \cdot PL.
\end{equation*}
PL follows the model in Section \ref{section:interference}. The antennas are directional and point to random directions. 
We assume that the antenna gain is invariant to the angle between antenna direction and the vertical axis, e.g., same for the LOS and the NLOS channel between two devices. 
The antenna gain follows a sectorized antenna model, i.e., 
\begin{equation*}
G = 
\begin{cases}
M, & w.p. ~ \theta/2\pi \\
m, & w.p. ~ 1-\theta/2\pi
\end{cases},
\end{equation*}
where $M$ is the antenna gain of main lobe, $m$ is the antenna gain out of the main lobe, $\theta$ is the beam width on the 2-D plane users are standing. 


There are two types of transmissions, beacon transmission and data transmission. To account for the heterogeneity of devices, e.g., transmission capabilities and QoS requirements, we classify data transmissions of each PBSS into to categories, primary data transmissions with higher priority and  highly directional antennas and secondary data transmissions with lower priority and less directional antennas. 


For modeling purposes, we assume that clusters are of the same size $K$ and there are $M$ channels. Each cluster includes the nearest neighbors of the cluster head and when possible each cluster chooses to operate on different channels than closest neighbor clusters.
In a typical cluster, we model the cluster head as located at the center while the other $K-1$ cluster members are its closest neighbors.
We assume the cluster members are uniformly distributed on a disc centered at the cluster head with a fixed radius $R_{\mathrm{cluster}}$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:clusteranalysis:model}. 
Suppose user density on the disc is the same as $\lambda$, then the expected number of users on the disc should be equal to the number of cluster members, $K - 1$, i.e., 
\begin{equation*}
\lambda \pi (R_{\mathrm{cluster}}^2 - r_{\min}^2) = K - 1,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{cluster}} = \sqrt{\frac{K - 1}{\lambda\pi}+r_{\min}^2}.
\end{equation*}.


Channel selection ensures neighboring clusters operate on different channels and form an inter-cluster interference protection region, see Fig.~\ref{fig:clusteranalysis:model}.
Assume the number of clusters on each channel is equal, and all other users operating on the same channel are modeled as uniformly distributed outside the protection region, following a HPPP with density $\lambda/M$.
Assume the number of users in the protection area of each cluster is equal, and protection areas are non-overlapping, then there should be $M\cdot K$ users in the protection area. 
Suppose the user density in the protection region is $\lambda$, then we have 
\begin{equation*}
\lambda \pi (R_{\mathrm{protection}}^2 - r_{\min}^2) = M\cdot K - 1,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{protect}} = \sqrt{\frac{M\cdot K - 1}{\lambda \pi} + r_{\min}^2}.
\end{equation*}
All users outside the cluster are not synchronized with the cluster and work independently from each other.  

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.35\textwidth]{Clustering_model.pdf}
	\caption{Model of a typical cluster using clustering and channel selection. Red circles represent users working on the same channel.}
	\label{fig:clusteranalysis:model}
\end{figure}


Next we introduce a model for scheduling.
There is at most one transmission in each PBSS in each slot. 
Two transmissions interfere with each other if the received power at either receiver exceeds a threshold.

Let $T_{\mathrm{frame}}$ denote the length of frame and $T_{\mathrm{beacon}}$ as the length of one BTI. 
The cluster head reserves exactly $K$ BTIs thus the proportion of data reserved for data transmission is given by
\begin{equation*}
f_{\mathrm{data}} = \frac{T_{\mathrm{data}}}{T_{\mathrm{frame}}} = \frac{T_{\mathrm{frame}} - K\cdot T_{\mathrm{beacon}}} {T_{\mathrm{frame}}}.
\end{equation*}
In each BTI, exactly one PCP will transmit its beacon and the other devices will attempt to receive the beacon using omni-directional receive mode. 

The PBSSs are full-buffer and schedule primary transmissions a proportion $\rho_{\mathrm{primary}}\in[0,1]$ of slots for data transmission and schedule secondary transmissions for the remaining $\rho_{\mathrm{secondary}} =1 - \rho_{\mathrm{primary}}$  slots. 

We consider two types of scheduling within the cluster, TDMA and Hierarchical Resource Reuse (HRR). In TDMA scheduling, PBSSs share the slots equally within the cluster and the fraction of time that a PBSS can access the channel in a frame is given by, 
\begin{equation*}
p_{\mathrm{access}}^{\mathrm{TDMA}} = f_{\mathrm{data}}/K.
\end{equation*}
A PBSS will schedule primary transmissions in $\rho_{\mathrm{primary}}f_{\mathrm{data}}/K$ slots, and secondary transmissions in $(1-\rho_{\mathrm{primary}})f_{\mathrm{data}}/K$ slots. 

In HRR, each PBSS is allocated $1/K$ of the slots where it has higher priority. 
The PBSS first schedules a primary transmission in the reserved slots and schedules other transmissions by reusing the slots allocated to other PBSSs. 
If $\rho_{\mathrm{primary}}\leq 1/K$, the PBSS also schedules secondary transmissions in the allocated slots. 
Other PBSSs will try to reuse the slots if they do not interfere with the primary user owning the slots.
The probability that a PBSS can reuse a given slot is approximated by
\begin{equation*}
p_{\mathrm{access}}^{\mathrm{HRR}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{clear}}\cdot \frac{1}{1+\E[N_{\mathrm{intra-cluster}}^{\mathrm{clear}}]},
\end{equation*}
where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{clear}}$ is the probability that the PBSS does not interfere with the primary PBSS, 
%$N_{\mathrm{intra-cluster}}$ is the number of intra-cluster interferers, i.e., PBSSs within the same cluster whose transmissions interferes with the transmission of the typical PBSS.  
$N_{\mathrm{intra-cluster}}^{\mathrm{clear}}$ is number of intra-cluster interferers that are secondary users in the slot and do not interfere with the primary user, i.e., the number of PBSSs contending with the typical PBSS to reuse the slot.


A PBSS's transmission is successful if the transmission is not interfered by transmissions outside the cluster. 
Denote by $N_{\mathrm{inter-cluster}}$ as the number of inter-cluster interfering transmissions. 
The activities of inter-cluster interferers are assumed to be mutually independent thus $N_{\mathrm{inter-cluster}}$ follows a Poisson distribution and the probability of a successful transmission can be well approximated as follows, 
\begin{equation*}
p_{\mathrm{success}} = e^{-\E[N_{\mathrm{inter-cluster}}]}.
\end{equation*} 
$\E[N_{\mathrm{inter-cluster}}]$ is related to the transmission patterns of PBSSs, which in turn depends on the location of PBSSs within the cluster. 
We use the transmission pattern of a user $\sqrt{2}R_{\mathrm{cluster}}$ away from the cluster head as the typical transmission pattern.

\subsection{Numerical Results and Discussion}
In this section, we compute the STT for different scenarios and characterize the cluster size that maximizes the sum STT of users. 
The parameters used in our analysis are listed in Table \ref{tab:clusteranalysis:parameter}, the typical user is the cluster head.

\textbf{Trade-off with cluster size} In Fig.~\ref{fig:clusteranalysis:basic} we show how STT and $p_{\mathrm{success}}$ vary with cluster size.  
$p_{\mathrm{success}}$ increases with $K$ while $p_{\mathrm{data}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{access}}$ decrease. 
STT first increases with $K$, then saturates and decreases, indicating that while large clusters may provide good inter-cluster interference mitigation, they increase the contention between users within the same cluster as well as signaling overheads. 
%The STT of primary transmissions is maximized when cluster size is small while the STT of secondary transmissions is maximized for larger $K$, showing that secondary transmissions benefit more from interference mitigation of larger clusters.

	\label{fig:clusteranalysis:basic}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Heterogeneity of devices} Fig.~\ref{fig:clusteranalysis:primary_ratio} exhibits the STT when users have different proportions of primary transmissions, $\rho_{\mathrm{primary}}$.
The optimal cluster size is smaller when transmissions are more directional. 
Results suggest that highly directional devices are less dependent on clustering to mitigate interference, thus users with highly directional devices may favor small clusters or be better off not joining clusters at all.

	\caption{STT for different tranffic patterns $\rho_{\mathrm{primary}}$.}
	\label{fig:clusteranalysis:primary_ratio}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Optimal cluster size v.s. user density} In Fig.~\ref{fig:clustereanalysis:optimal_cluster_size} we show how the cluster size maximizing the STT changes with the user density. 
When user density is high, the optimal cluster size does not change very much, indicating that optimal cluster size are pretty robust to user density. 
However, as we have discussed, the directionality and proportion of different types of traffic influence the optimal cluster size. 

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width = 0.3\textwidth]{Cluster_analysis_optimal_cluster_size.pdf}
	\caption{Cluster size that maximizes STT for different user densities.}
	\label{fig:clustereanalysis:optimal_cluster_size}
\end{figure}

\textbf{STT v.s. user density} In Fig.~\ref{fig:clusteranalysis:compare_mac} we compare the STT for different MAC protocols for different user densities. 
At each user density, the cluster size is chosen as the one that maximizes the total STT for hierarchical MAC with clustering. 
For Aloha, we assume users select channels randomly and the access probability is optimized to maximize the total STT. 
We observe that clustering and reuse provide moderate gains in STT, partly due to beacon overheads. %but can substantially improve the probability of successful transmission. 
We also note that the total STT first decreases with user density then starts to increase with density.
Our result here is different from the existing scaling results on ad hoc networks in that the transmit power or the signal strength does not change with density.
Such a result is in line with our analysis of the interference environment that in very dense networks, close by neighbors block the interference from distant interferers thus the interference in dense environments may not be the worst case.

%Conclusion for analysis of clusters?

\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}	
Our analysis of character of interference strong interferers in dense mmWave wearable networks suggests such networks might be quite viable. 
Blockage and directionality help limit the number of strong interferers to a few that are close by and stable.
For a relative stationary network, clustering with resource reuse is a viable solution to coordinating the PBSSs. 
Finding the optimal cluster size requires optimizing a trade-off between interference mitigation and resource reuse within clusters thus an ideal cluster protocol should adapt to different environment.
